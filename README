== onTap ?

The reason behind this small library is to help you with tap/double tap/hold gestures
It is build to be fast and easy to set up

It won't work on devices without touchstart event support

It also solves the problem with active state when you scroll a page
if you'll move your finger by a small factor
Active state will be turned off

== Usage

on('#selector').tap(function(){});
on('#selector').tap(function(){}, 'activeClass');

var T = on('#selector');

T.tap(function(){}).dblTap(function(){}).hold(function(){});

T.removeAll();

on(document.body).tap({'.element': function(){}})
